\section{Long read assembly}

\subsection{The advantage of long read assembly against reptitions in genomes}
% Genomes have repeated sequences
% - bacteria
% - plants
% - humans
% A long read is more likely to contain a repeated sequence in its entirety.

\subsection{The long read sequencing technology errors issue}
% ShortRead as Illumina (error type+rate ?)
% Nanopore (error type+rate ?) (prize ?)
% PacBio (error type+rate ?) (prize ?)
% NOVEL SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIE DESCRIBED IN SFAF MEETING (?)
% FIGURE IN NGSA (?) -> ANSWER ANTOINE ROLLAND IF POSSIBLE

\subsection{The hybrid method to correct short read assembly}
% Correction of errors thanks to short read
% REFERENCE OF SEBASTIEN FRANCOIS (?)

\section{The linear optimization : a mathematical exact approach}
% The main idea
% Why it is important to have an exact approach :
% - in medecin to detect variants
% - to reduce error rate in others analysis (RNA/DNA-seq)
% Today, a lot of heuristics are used (quote SPAce and BEEST)
