	Abstract = {Summary: ART is a set of simulation tools that generate synthetic next-generation sequencing reads. This functionality is essential for testing and benchmarking tools for next-generation sequencing data analysis including read alignment, de novo assembly and genetic variation discovery. ART generates simulated sequencing reads by emulating the sequencing process with built-in, technology-specific read error models and base quality value profiles parameterized empirically in large sequencing datasets. We currently support all three major commercial next-generation sequencing platforms: Roche's 454, Illumina's Solexa and Applied Biosystems' SOLiD. ART also allows the flexibility to use customized read error model parameters and quality profiles.Availability: Both source and binary software packages are available at http://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/artContact: weichun.huang@nih.gov; gabor.marth@bc.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Mandric17042015,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Next-generation high-throughput sequencing has become a state-of-the-art technique in genome assembly. Scaffolding is one of the main stages of the assembly pipeline. During this stage, contigs assembled from the paired-end reads are merged into bigger chains called scaffolds. Because of a high level of statistical noise, chimeric reads, and genome repeats the problem of scaffolding is a challenging task. Current scaffolding software packages widely vary in their quality and are highly dependent on the read data quality and genome complexity. There are no clear winners and multiple opportunities for further improvements of the tools still exist.Results: This article presents an efficient scaffolding algorithm ScaffMatch that is able to handle reads with both short (<600 bp) and long (>35 000 bp) insert sizes producing high-quality scaffolds. We evaluate our scaffolding tool with the F score and other metrics (N50, corrected N50) on eight datasets comparing it with the most available packages. Our experiments show that ScaffMatch is the tool of preference for the most datasets.Availability and implementation: The source code is available at http://alan.cs.gsu.edu/NGS/?q=content/scaffmatch.Contact: mandric@cs.gsu.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {The circular chloroplast {DNA}s from spinach, lettuce, and corn plants have been examined by electron microscopy and shown to contain a large sequence repeated one time in reverse polarity. The inverted sequence in spinach and lettuce chloroplast DNA has been found to be 24,400 base pairs long. The inverted sequence in the corn chloroplast DNA is 22,500 base pairs long. Denaturation mapping studies have shown that the structure of the inverted sequence is highly conserved in these three plants. Pea chloroplast DNA does not contain an inverted repeat. All of the circular dimers of pea chloroplast DNA are found to be in a head-to-tail confirmation. Circular dimers of spinach and lettuce were also found to have head-to-tail conformation. However, approximately 70-80{\%} of the circular dimers in preparations of lettuce and spinach chloroplast DNA were found to be in a head-to-head conformation. We propose that the head-to-head circular dimers are formed by a recombination event between two circular monomers in the inverted sequence. IMAGES:},

@article{Medvedev_11,
	Abstract = {The recent proliferation of next generation sequencing with short reads has enabled many new experimental opportunities but, at the same time, has raised formidable computational challenges in genome assembly. One of the key advances that has led to an improvement in contig lengths has been mate pairs, which facilitate the assembly of repeating regions. Mate pairs have been algorithmically incorporated into most next generation assemblers as various heuristic post-processing steps to correct the assembly graph or to link contigs into scaffolds. Such methods have allowed the identification of longer contigs than would be possible with single reads; however, they can still fail to resolve complex repeats. Thus, improved methods for incorporating mate pairs will have a strong effect on contig length in the future. Here, we introduce the paired de Bruijn graph, a generalization of the de Bruijn graph that incorporates mate pair information into the graph structure itself instead of analyzing mate pairs at a post-processing step. This graph has the potential to be used in place of the de Bruijn graph in any de Bruijn graph based assembler, maintaining all other assembly steps such as error-correction and repeat resolution. Through assembly results on simulated perfect data, we argue that this can effectively improve the contig sizes in assembly.},

	Abstract = {For the last 20 years, fragment assembly in DNA sequencing
 followed the ``overlap--layout----nsensus'''' padigm that is used
 in all currently available assembly tools. Although this approach
 proved useful in assembling clones, it faces difficulties in genomic
 shotgun assembly. We abandon the classical
 ``overlap--layout----nsensus'''' aroach in favor of a new
 euler algorithm that, for the first time, resolves the
 20-year-old ``repeat problem'' in fragment assembly. Our main
 result is the reduction of the fragment assembly to a variation of the
 classical Eulerian path problem that allows one to generate accurate
 solutions of large-scale sequencing problems. euler, in
 contrast to the celera assembler, does not mask such
 repeats but uses them instead as a powerful fragment assembly tool.},

	Abstract = {De novo genome sequence assembly is important both to generate new sequence assemblies for previously uncharacterized genomes and to identify the genome sequence of individuals in a reference-unbiased way. We present memory efficient data structures and algorithms for assembly using the {FM}-index derived from the compressed Burrows-Wheeler transform, and a new assembler based on these called {SGA} (String Graph Assembler). We describe algorithms to error-correct, assemble, and scaffold large sets of sequence data. {SGA} uses the overlap-based string graph model of assembly, unlike most de novo assemblers that rely on de Bruijn graphs, and is simply parallelizable. We demonstrate the error correction and assembly performance of {SGA} on 1.2 billion sequence reads from a human genome, which we are able to assemble using 54 {GB} of memory. The resulting contigs are highly accurate and contiguous, while covering 95\% of the reference genome (excluding contigs {\textless}200 bp in length). Because of the low memory requirements and parallelization without requiring inter-process communication, {SGA} provides the first practical assembler to our knowledge for a mammalian-sized genome on a low-end computing cluster.},

@article{van_belkum_short-sequence_1998,
	Abstract = {Short-sequence DNA repeat (SSR) loci can be identified in all eukaryotic and many prokaryotic genomes. These loci harbor short or long stretches of repeated nucleotide sequence motifs. DNA sequence motifs in a single locus can be identical and/or heterogeneous. SSRs are encountered in many different branches of the prokaryote kingdom. They are found in genes encoding products as diverse as microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules and specific bacterial virulence factors such as lipopolysaccharide-modifying enzymes or adhesins. SSRs enable genetic and consequently phenotypic flexibility. SSRs function at various levels of gene expression regulation. Variations in the number of repeat units per locus or changes in the nature of the individual repeat sequences may result from recombination processes or polymerase inadequacy such as slipped-strand mispairing (SSM), either alone or in combination with DNA repair deficiencies. These rather complex phenomena can occur with relative ease, with SSM approaching a frequency of 10−4 per bacterial cell division and allowing high-frequency genetic switching. Bacteria use this random strategy to adapt their genetic repertoire in response to selective environmental pressure. SSR-mediated variation has important implications for bacterial pathogenesis and evolutionary fitness. Molecular analysis of changes in SSRs allows epidemiological studies on the spread of pathogenic bacteria. The occurrence, evolution and function of SSRs, and the molecular methods used to analyze them are discussed in the context of responsiveness to environmental factors, bacterial pathogenicity, epidemiology, and the availability of full-genome sequences for increasing numbers of microorganisms, especially those that are medically relevant.},

@article{wiedenbeck_origins_2011,
	Abstract = {Horizontal genetic transfer (HGT) has played an important role in bacterial evolution at least since the origins of the bacterial divisions, and HGT still facilitates the origins of bacterial diversity, including diversity based on antibiotic resistance. Adaptive HGT is aided by unique features of genetic exchange in bacteria such as the promiscuity of genetic exchange and the shortness of segments transferred. Genetic exchange rates are limited by the genetic and ecological similarity of organisms. Adaptive transfer of genes is limited to those that can be transferred as a functional unit, provide a niche-transcending adaptation, and are compatible with the architecture and physiology of other organisms. Horizontally transferred adaptations may bring about fitness costs, and natural selection may ameliorate these costs. The origins of ecological diversity can be analyzed by comparing the genomes of recently divergent, ecologically distinct populations, which can be discovered as sequence clusters. Such genome comparisons demonstrate the importance of HGT in ecological diversification. Newly divergent populations cannot be discovered as sequence clusters when their ecological differences are coded by plasmids, as is often the case for antibiotic resistance; the discovery of such populations requires a screen for plasmid-coded functions. This paper reviews the features of bacterial genetics that allow HGT, the similarities between organisms that foster HGT between them, the limits to the kinds of adaptations that can be transferred, and amelioration of fitness costs associated with HGT; the paper also reviews approaches to discover the origins of new, ecologically distinct bacterial populations and the role that HGT plays in their founding.},

@article{madoui_genome_2015,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-read sequencing technologies were launched a few years ago, and in contrast with short-read sequencing technologies, they offered a promise of solving assembly problems for large and complex genomes. Moreover by providing long-range information, it could also solve haplotype phasing. However, existing long-read technologies still have several limitations that complicate their use for most research laboratories, as well as in large and/or complex genome projects. In 2014, Oxford Nanopore released the MinION{\textregistered} device, a small and low-cost single-molecule nanopore sequencer, which offers the possibility of sequencing long DNA fragments.
RESULTS: The assembly of long reads generated using the Oxford Nanopore MinION{\textregistered} instrument is challenging as existing assemblers were not implemented to deal with long reads exhibiting close to 30\% of errors. Here, we presented a hybrid approach developed to take advantage of data generated using MinION{\textregistered} device. We sequenced a well-known bacterium, Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 and applied our method to obtain a highly contiguous (one single contig) and accurate genome assembly even in repetitive regions, in contrast to an Illumina-only assembly. Our hybrid strategy was able to generate NaS (Nanopore Synthetic-long) reads up to 60  kb that aligned ntirely and with no error to the reference genome and that spanned highly conserved repetitive regions. The average accuracy of NaS reads reached 99.99\% without losing the initial size of the input MinION{\textregistered}{\textregistered} reads.          NaS tool, a hybrid approach allowing the sequencing of microbial genomes using the MinION{\textregistered}{\textregistered} device. Our method, based ideally on 20x and 50x of NaS and Illumina reads respectively, provides an efficient and cost-effective way of sequencing microbial or small eukaryotic genomes in a very short time even in small facilities. Moreover, we demonstrated that although the Oxford Nanopore technology is a relatively new sequencing technology, currently with a high error rate, it is already useful in the generation of high-quality genome assemblies.},

	Abstract = {SUMMARY: Limitations of genome sequencing techniques have led to dozens of assembly algorithms, none of which is perfect. A number of methods for comparing assemblers have been developed, but none is yet a recognized benchmark. Further, most existing methods for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new assemblies of finished genomes; the problem of evaluating assemblies of previously unsequenced species has not been adequately considered. Here, we present QUAST-a quality assessment tool for evaluating and comparing genome assemblies. This tool improves on leading assembly comparison software with new ideas and quality metrics. QUAST can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome, as well as without a reference. QUAST produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications. In this study, we used QUAST to compare several genome assemblers on three datasets. QUAST tables and plots for all of them are available in the Supplementary Material, and interactive versions of these reports are on the QUAST website.

The MinION nanopore sequencer can produce long sequencing reads on a device similar in size to a USB memory stick. Here we apply a MinION sequencer to resolve the structure and chromosomal insertion site of a composite antibiotic resistance island in Salmonella Typhi Haplotype 58. Nanopore sequencing data from a single 18-h run was used to create a scaffold for an assembly generated from short-read Illumina data. Our results demonstrate the potential of the MinION device in clinical laboratories to fully characterize the epidemic spread of bacterial pathogens.},

It provides graph visualization for tools and web sites in domains such as software engineering, networking, databases, knowledge representation, and bio-informatics. Hundreds of thousands of copies have been distributed under an open source license. The core of Graphviz consists of implementations of various common types of graph layout. These layouts can be used via a C library interface, streambased command line tools, graphical user interfaces and web browsers. Aspects which distinguish the software include a retention of stream-based interfaces in conjunction with a variety of tools for graph manipulation, and support for a wide assortment of graphical features and output formats. The former makes it possible to write high-level programs for querying, modifying and displaying graphs. The latter allows Graphviz to be useful in a wide range of areas, with applications far removed from academic exercises. The algorithms of Graphviz concentrate on static layouts. Dynagraph is a sibling of Graphviz, with algorithms and interactive programs for incremental layout. At the library level, it provides an object-oriented interface for graphs and graph algorithms.},

@article{boetzer_scaffolding_2011,
	Abstract = {SUMMARY: De novo assembly tools play a main role in reconstructing genomes from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and usually yield a number of contigs. Using paired-read sequencing data it is possible to assess the order, distance and orientation of contigs and combine them into so-called scaffolds. Although the latter process is a crucial step in finishing genomes, scaffolding algorithms are often built-in functions in de novo assembly tools and cannot be independently controlled. We here present a new tool, called SSPACE, which is a stand-alone scaffolder of pre-assembled contigs using paired-read data. Main features are: a short runtime, multiple library input of paired-end and/or mate pair datasets and possible contig extension with unmapped sequence reads. SSPACE shows promising results on both prokaryote and eukaryote genomic testsets where the amount of initial contigs was reduced by at least 75\%.},

Using an efficient data structure called a suffix tree, the system is able to rapidly align sequences containing millions of nucleotides. Its use is demonstrated on two strains of Mycoplasma tuberculosis, on two less similar species of Mycoplasma bacteria and on two syntenic sequences from human chromosome 12 and mouse chromosome 6. In each case it found an alignment of the input sequences, using between 30 s and 2 min of computation time. From the system output, information on single nucleotide changes, translocations and homologous genes can easily be extracted. Use of the algorithm should facilitate analysis of syntenic chromosomal regions, strain-to-strain comparisons, evolutionary comparisons and genomic duplications.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Scaffolding is the process of ordering and orienting contigs produced during genome assembly. Accurate scaffolding is essential for finishing draft assemblies, as it facilitates the costly and laborious procedures needed to fill in the gaps between contigs. Conventional formulations of the scaffolding problem are intractable, and most scaffolding programs rely on heuristic or approximate solutions, with potentially exponential running time.
RESULTS: We present SCARPA, a novel scaffolder, which combines fixed-parameter tractable and bounded algorithms with Linear Programming to produce near-optimal scaffolds. We test SCARPA on real datasets in addition to a simulated diploid genome and compare its performance with several state-of-the-art scaffolders. We show that SCARPA produces longer or similar length scaffolds that are highly accurate compared with other scaffolders. SCARPA is also capable of detecting misassembled contigs and reports them during scaffolding.

The new system, MUMmer 2, runs three times faster while using one-third as much memory as the original MUMmer system. It has been used successfully to align the entire human and mouse genomes to each other, and to align numerous smaller eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. A new module permits the alignment of multiple DNA sequence fragments, which has proven valuable in the comparison of incomplete genome sequences. We also describe a method to align more distantly related genomes by detecting protein sequence homology. This extension to MUMmer aligns two genomes after translating the sequence in all six reading frames, extracts all matching protein sequences and then clusters together matches. This method has been applied to both incomplete and complete genome sequences in order to detect regions of conserved synteny, in which multiple proteins from one organism are found in the same order and orientation in another.

@article{venter_sequence_2001,
	Abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp {DNA} sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the {DNA} of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic {DNA}. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. {DNA} sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all {SNPs} resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which {SNPs} have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

@article{hunt_comprehensive_2014,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Genome assembly is typically a two-stage process: contig assembly followed by the use of paired sequencing reads to join contigs into scaffolds. Scaffolds are usually the focus of reported assembly statistics; longer scaffolds greatly facilitate the use of genome sequences in downstream analyses, and it is appealing to present larger numbers as metrics of assembly performance. However, scaffolds are highly prone to errors, especially when generated using short reads, which can directly result in inflated assembly statistics.
{RESULTS}: Here we provide the first independent evaluation of scaffolding tools for second-generation sequencing data. We find large variations in the quality of results depending on the tool and dataset used. Even extremely simple test cases of perfect input, constructed to elucidate the behaviour of each algorithm, produced some surprising results. We further dissect the performance of the scaffolders using real and simulated sequencing data derived from the genomes of Staphylococcus aureus, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Plasmodium falciparum and Homo sapiens. The results from simulated data are of high quality, with several of the tools producing perfect output. However, at least 10\% of joins remains unidentified when using real data.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The scaffolders vary in their usability, speed and number of correct and missed joins made between contigs. Results from real data highlight opportunities for further improvements of the tools. Overall, {SGA}, {SOPRA} and {SSPACE} generally outperform the other tools on our datasets. However, the quality of the results is highly dependent on the read mapper and genome complexity.},

@article{bosi_medusa:_2015,
	Abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Completing the genome sequence of an organism is an important task in comparative, functional and structural genomics. However, this remains a challenging issue from both a computational and an experimental viewpoint. Genome scaffolding (i.e. the process of ordering and orientating contigs) of de novo assemblies usually represents the first step in most genome finishing pipelines.
{RESULTS}: In this paper, we present {MeDuSa} (Multi-Draft based Scaffolder), an algorithm for genome scaffolding. {MeDuSa} exploits information obtained from a set of (draft or closed) genomes from related organisms to determine the correct order and orientation of the contigs. {MeDuSa} formalises the scaffolding problem by means of a combinatorial optimisation formulation on graphs and implements an efficient constant factor approximation algorithm to solve it. In contrast to currently used scaffolders, it does not require either prior knowledge on the microrganisms dataset under analysis (e.g. their phylogenetic relationships) or the availability of paired end read libraries. This makes usability and running time two additional important features of our method. Moreover, benchmarks and tests on real bacterial datasets showed that {MeDuSa} is highly accurate and, in most cases, outperforms traditional scaffolders. The possibility to use {MeDuSa} on eukaryotic datasets has also been evaluated, leading to interesting results.
{AVAILABILITY}: {MeDuSa} web server: http://combo.dbe.unifi.it/medusa A stand-alone version of the software can be downloaded from https://github.com/combogenomics/medusa/releases. All results presented in this work have been obtained with {MeDuSa} v. 1.3.

The Contig Scaffolding Problem is to order and orientate the given contigs in a manner that is consistent with as many mate-pairs as possible. This paper describes an efficient heuristic called the greedy-path merging algorithm for solving this problem. The method was originally developed as a key component of the compartmentalized assembly strategy developed at Celera Genomics. This interim approach was used at an early stage of the sequencing of the human genome to produce a preliminary assembly based on preliminary whole genome shotgun data produced at Celera and preliminary human contigs produced by the Human Genome Project.},

	Abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Scaffolding is the process of ordering and orienting contigs produced during genome assembly. Accurate scaffolding is essential for finishing draft assemblies, as it facilitates the costly and laborious procedures needed to fill in the gaps between contigs. Conventional formulations of the scaffolding problem are intractable, and most scaffolding programs rely on heuristic or approximate solutions, with potentially exponential running time.
{RESULTS}: We present {SCARPA}, a novel scaffolder, which combines fixed-parameter tractable and bounded algorithms with Linear Programming to produce near-optimal scaffolds. We test {SCARPA} on real datasets in addition to a simulated diploid genome and compare its performance with several state-of-the-art scaffolders. We show that {SCARPA} produces longer or similar length scaffolds that are highly accurate compared with other scaffolders. {SCARPA} is also capable of detecting misassembled contigs and reports them during scaffolding.
{AVAILABILITY}: {SCARPA} is open source and available from http://compbio.cs.toronto.edu/scarpa.},

	Abstract = {Low-cost short read sequencing technology has revolutionized genomics, though it is only just becoming practical for the high-quality de novo assembly of a novel large genome. We describe the Assemblathon 1 competition, which aimed to comprehensively assess the state of the art in de novo assembly methods when applied to current sequencing technologies. In a collaborative effort, teams were asked to assemble a simulated Illumina {HiSeq} data set of an unknown, simulated diploid genome. A total of 41 assemblies from 17 different groups were received. Novel haplotype aware assessments of coverage, contiguity, structure, base calling, and copy number were made. We establish that within this benchmark: (1) It is possible to assemble the genome to a high level of coverage and accuracy, and that (2) large differences exist between the assemblies, suggesting room for further improvements in current methods. The simulated benchmark, including the correct answer, the assemblies, and the code that was used to evaluate the assemblies is now public and freely available from http://www.assemblathon.org/.},

@article{pop_hierarchical_2004,
	Abstract = {The output of a genome assembler generally comprises a collection of contiguous {DNA} sequences (contigs) whose relative placement along the genome is not defined. A procedure called scaffolding is commonly used to order and orient these contigs using paired read information. This ordering of contigs is an essential step when finishing and analyzing the data from a whole-genome shotgun project. Most recent assemblers include a scaffolding module; however, users have little control over the scaffolding algorithm or the information produced. We thus developed a general-purpose scaffolder, called Bambus, which affords users significant flexibility in controlling the scaffolding parameters. Bambus was used recently to scaffold the low-coverage draft dog genome data. Most significantly, Bambus enables the use of linking data other than that inferred from mate-pair information. For example, the sequence of a completed genome can be used to guide the scaffolding of a related organism. We present several applications of Bambus: support for finishing, comparative genomics, analysis of the haplotype structure of genomes, and scaffolding of a mammalian genome at low coverage. Bambus is available as an open-source package from our Web site.},

The 14.8-billion bp {DNA} sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the {DNA} of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic {DNA}. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. {DNA} sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all {SNPs} resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which {SNPs} have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

@article{bradnam_assemblathon_2013,
	Abstract = {Background
The process of generating raw genome sequence data continues to become cheaper, faster, and more accurate. However, assembly of such data into high-quality, finished genome sequences remains challenging. Many genome assembly tools are available, but they differ greatly in terms of their performance (speed, scalability, hardware requirements, acceptance of newer read technologies) and in their final output (composition of assembled sequence). More importantly, it remains largely unclear how to best assess the quality of assembled genome sequences. The Assemblathon competitions are intended to assess current state-of-the-art methods in genome assembly.

Results
In Assemblathon 2, we provided a variety of sequence data to be assembled for three vertebrate species (a bird, a fish, and snake). This resulted in a total of 43 submitted assemblies from 21 participating teams. We evaluated these assemblies using a combination of optical map data, Fosmid sequences, and several statistical methods. From over 100 different metrics, we chose ten key measures by which to assess the overall quality of the assemblies.

Conclusions
Many current genome assemblers produced useful assemblies, containing a significant representation of their genes and overall genome structure. However, the high degree of variability between the entries suggests that there is still much room for improvement in the field of genome assembly and that approaches which work well in assembling the genome of one species may not necessarily work well for another.},

	Abstract = {We have developed a new set of algorithms, collectively called ``Velvet,'''to manipulate de Bruijn graphs for genomic sequence assembly. A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (k-mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25----5bp) data sets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian {BACs}. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of ∼8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian {BAC}, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.},

@article{li_fast_2009,
	Abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new {DNA} sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including {MAQ}, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, {MAQ} does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of {MAQ} is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
{RESULTS}: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool ({BWA}), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform ({BWT}), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. {BWA} supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from {AB} {SOLiD} machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that {BWA} is approximately 10-20x faster than {MAQ}, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, {BWA} outputs alignment in the new standard {SAM} (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source {SAMtools} software package.
