\section{The effeciency of the subseq filter}
% HOW MANY READ ARE REMOVED ?
% HOW MANY OVERLAPS ARE REMOVED ?

\section{Partitioning and connected component separation is coherent with real cordinates}
% SHOW THE GRAPH SMALL_ECOLI OR ECOLI
% Because we know the exact position of generated read,
% each read belonged to a partition was ordered in a scale genome
% a line = one partition, horizontal axis is the pos on the scaled genome
% Essentitiatly due to connected component separation because metis partitioning is coarse

\section{The heaviest path model implementation is robust against a little hard example}
% SHOW EXAMPLE
% RUN 100 TIMES AND MAKE GRAPHIC STAT OF TIME

\section{The heaviest path model solution is coherent on (number) given partitions and fast}
% RUN ON (number) PARTITIONS AND :
% MAKE GRAPHIC STAT OF TIME FOR ALL AND FOR MERGE
% MAKE GRAPHIC STAT OF |V| AND |E|
% MAKE GRAPH STAT OF ERROR RATE FOR MERGE
