\section{Material}

\subsection{Escherichia coli genome}
% from NCBI
% VERSION ?
% WHY ?
% -> known entire genome, studied a lot because of agroalimentaion
% -> short genome
% -> as a bacteria, has two main inversed repeated region (IRa and IRb)
% -> circular genome

\subsection{Use of NanoSim\cite{yang_nanosim:_2017} - a Oxford Nanopore long read generator}
% SOFTWARE REFERENCES
% DATE OF CREATION + LAST UPDATE (VERSION)
% ERROR TYPE AND RATE
% WHY ?

\subsection{Use of \textsc{blast}n for overlap alignment}
% SOFTWARE REFERENCES
% DATE OF CREATION + LAST UPDATE (VERSION)
% OPTIONS ALGO

\subsection{Use of \textsc{ampl}\cite{al-baali_ampl_2015} optimization mathematical implementation language}
% SOFTWARE REFERENCES
% DATE OF CREATION + LAST UPDATE (VERSION)
% This is a non-free software

\subsection{Use of \textsc{gurobi}\cite{rothberg_gurobi_nodate} solver to solve the implemented problems in \textsc{ampl}}
% SOLVER REFERENCES
% DATE OF CREATION + LAST UPDATE (VERSION)

\subsection{Use of \textsc{metis}\cite{karypis_fast_1998} - a graph partitioner}
% SOFTWARE REFERENCES
% DATE OF CREATION + LAST UPDATE (VERSION)

\subsection{Programmation with Python3 and Linux Bash}
% Version of python3 and bash

\subsection{Run material}
% Personal laptop on linux
% 16GB RAM
% i5-7th generation processor
% Ubuntu 18.10 OS

\section{Methods}

% Pipeline description
\subsection{Read generation with NanoSim}
% Obtain FASTA (FASTAQ ?)
% BY DOMINIQUE

\subsection{Read all vs all alignment with \textsc{blast}n and filter wanted overlap types}
% Blastn ALL VS ALL > .blastn
% Filter alignment to keep our description of overlap selectAlignBlast.py : EXPLAIN > .overlap
% Filter subseq with filter_subseq.py : EXPLAIN WHAT IS REMOVE ACCORDING PROPOSITION > _sf.overlap and dd_infos.save
% BY DOMINIQUE AND VICTOR (filterSUb)

\subsection{Partitioning the overlap graph in unique connected component}
% First partitioning with metis
% For each output partition, if it contains more than one connected component,
% separate them in n other partition, where n is equal to the number of
% connected component > Pi.overlap, Pj.overlap
% All the cut edges were kept in overlap file > Pi-j.overlap
% Other output : a graph of the partitions PG.data
% BY DOMINIQUE

\subsection{Finding the heaviest path in the partition graph}
% In order to arrange relative position between reads belonging to different partitions
% partitions_to_HP_PG_dat.py on PG.data > PG.dat (AMPL input)
% HP_PG.mod on PG.dat > {X[Pi,Pj]=1} (partition order)
% HOW IT WORKS ?
% GIVE COMPLEXITY
% BY RUMEN AND VICTOR

\subsection{Finding the heaviest path in each read partition}
% In each partition, AMPL give a path in the read graph : so a read order
% overlap_to_HP_LR_dat_v1.py on Pi.overlap, Ph-i.overlap and Pi-j.overlap if exist > Pi.dat
% Give the neighboored partition allows to know potential candidats for starter,
% intermediate and terminal reads in the path
% HP_L.mod on Pi.dat > {X[Ri,Rj]=1} (read order in partition i)
% GIVE COMPLEXITY
% BY RUMEN AND VICTOR

\subsection{Link the partitions}
% TODO

\subsection{Make concesus sequence with adding removed subsequences}
% A removed subseq is participating to the solution if and only if it alignes in
% just one place on the pre-concensus
% TODO

\subsection{Verification of concensus sequence with ?}
% TODO
